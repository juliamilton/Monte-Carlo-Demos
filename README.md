# Monte Carlo Demos

1. Before running the code, make sure to check out and read the corresponding tutorials provided in the PDFs. These indicate - among other things - where in the code the actual algorithm is being implemented (vs. the part of the code that plots) and where the user-defined inputs are.


2. When you are ready to run the code, please follow the next steps:

1. Open your terminal and `cd` to the location that your file is in.
2. Run `ipython`
3. Type `%matplotlib qt`
4. Type `%run rejectionSampling.py` or `%run importanceSampling.py` or `%run MCMC.py`

And the animation should start!
